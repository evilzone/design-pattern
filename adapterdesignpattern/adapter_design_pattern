LLD: Adapter Design Pattern (structural design pattern)
---------------------------

- bridge the gap between expected interface and existing interface
- Existing interface <-> Expected interface

- examples
    - power adapter (client) and socket (existing interface or adapter)
    - xml to json parser

        client                          adapter                                        server
        (want json response)           (convert xml to json)                          (return xml)

    - weight machine

        Kg       Adapter(pound to kg)          100 Pounds (existing interfacel, adapter)

    - we have three patterns
        - creational
        - behavioral
        - structural: clubbing together two or more more objects to create a bigger structure
