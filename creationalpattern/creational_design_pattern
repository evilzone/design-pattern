- creational design pattern responsibility is to create objects/ controls the creation of objects


    client  ------->     Prototype
                      << interface >>
                                            ----------->   class 1 [student]
                                                                clone()


                                            ----------->   class 2 [employee]
                                                                clone()


                                            ----------->   class n [professor]
                                                                clone()


- prototype interface also solves the consistency for the clone() method
