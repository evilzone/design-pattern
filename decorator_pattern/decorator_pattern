Decorator Pattern - Low level design
====================================

Use case:

- Pizza shop (base + toppings (cheese, mushroom, vegs))
- Car (base car + AC + seatcover + foglight)

Why you need decorator pattern? - to avoid class explosion.

- Class Explosion: managing classes become difficult with so many permutation and combination.
